            My high school is located in Kristiansand and is called "Kristiansand Katedralskole Gimle", however <br>
            we usually called it by its initials: "KKG". It was mainly a sports school, although, <br> 
            it still offered other academic studies, for example, I graduated from International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme.

        <p>My old school, Høyskolen Kristiania, is private university in Oslo. <br>
            As a school it mainly focuses on design courses and puts weight on collaboration between courses <br>
            I studied, and finished a bachelor in, Game Design.  <br>

            My high school was pretty small and the school did not consist of many students. <br>
            My school´s name was Nes, and it is in Årnes in Nes kommune. <br>
            They only have a phew different programs/paths, <br>
            such as general studies, sports, construction and work sites, electro and health and care. <br>
            I studied general studies with a focus on stem.

            My high school is very far north in the country. It is called "Senja Videregående Skole, avd Finnfjordborn"<br>
            This school has two different sections. The one i was in focuses more on general studies, <br>
            and the other one has more practical courses, to become fishermen and farmers.<br>
            I studied general studies with chemistry and "R math".

            I studied at the same high school as Edvard Uteng, namely Senja VGS at Finnfjordbotn. It is located in the middle of Troms, <br>
            and has space for around 60-80, if I remember correctly, students, to sleep at an integrated dormitory. This is perfect for<br>
            all the international students studying IB, and for students traveling from all over Troms to study there. <br>
            I learnt alot from my three years there, and I still have fond memories from the classes of some of the teachers. They were good at what they did.<br>
            Other than that we had a quite decent cafeteria, and they sold wheat buns for 8kr, which was always popular.
