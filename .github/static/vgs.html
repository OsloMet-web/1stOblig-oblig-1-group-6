            My high school is located in Kristiansand and is called "Kristiansand Katedralskole Gimle", however <br>
            we usually called it by its initials: "KKG". It was mainly a sports school, although, <br> 
            it still offered other academic studies, for example, I graduated from International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme.

            My high school was pretty small and the school did not consist of many students. <br>
            My school´s name was Nes, and it is in Årnes in Nes kommune. <br>
            They only have a phew different programs/paths, <br>
            such as general studies, sports, construction and work sites, electro and health and care. <br>
            I studied general studies with a focus on stem.
