            My high school was pretty small and the school did not consist of many students. <br>
            My school´s name was Nes, and it is in Årnes in Nes kommune. <br>
            They only have a phew different programs/paths, <br>
            such as general studies, sports, construction and work sites, electro and health and care. <br>
            I studied general studies with a focus on stem.
